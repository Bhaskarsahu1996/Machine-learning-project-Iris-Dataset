Machine-learning-project-Iris-Dataset
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
The iris dataset consists of 5 features:

>  SepalLength
>  SepalWidth
>  PetalLength
>  PetalWidth
>  Species-(Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica and Iris-versicolor)

The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes heavy use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries.
